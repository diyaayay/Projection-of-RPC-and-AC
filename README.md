# Projection-of-RPC-and-AC
This project would project the Recovery point creation and Projection Cost.

**Projection of Run** :
Since each recovery point can have an expiry set on it – 
We must determine how many copies will exist because of this policy execution at any given instant with an identification of its source

**Cost Projection** :
With every recovery point that is created – new delta of data will get backed up and take up space on the device. Certain parameters will be provided to consider cost calculation of maintaining these recovery points
We need to predict how much the cost will be at a future point in time, based on how much delta is expected based on previous data as well as the cost associated parameters

**Detection of overlaps in schedules** :
Warnings to be issued to the user

 

# To Run The Project: 
- Run main.py of the root directory
